# Learning Python Basics for Data Analysis Bootcamp 📊🐍

Welcome to my repo where I’m documenting my journey through the Python basics as part of the Data Analysis Bootcamp with Just IT! 🎓✨

This repo is all about learning the fundamentals of Python, from data types and loops to libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. I’m keeping it super chill, with plenty of notes, practice exercises, and examples to help solidify the concepts.

Feel free to follow along, contribute, or ask questions if you're also diving into Python for data analysis!
